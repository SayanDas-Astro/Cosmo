# 📚 CITATION CHEAT SHEET
## "Who are these people and why did I cite them?"

You asked for a professional paper with citations to avoid "allegations or false information." This guide explains **exactly** who you cited and why, so you can defend your paper like a pro.

### 🏛️ The "Giants" (Foundational Papers)
*If someone asks: "Is this based on standard theory?" - You point to these.*

**1. Kormendy & Ho (2013)**
*   **Who:** Examples of the biggest authorities in the field.
*   **What they found:** Establish the standard scaling relations (black hole mass correlates with bulge mass) for normal galaxies.
*   **Why you cite them:** To show the "normal" baseline that BCGs are deviating from.

**2. Magorrian et al. (1998)**
*   **Who:** The pioneers.
*   **What they found:** First big study showing *almost every* galaxy has a supermassive black hole.
*   **Why you cite them:** To establish that black holes are ubiquitous.

**3. Silk & Rees (1998) / Fabian (2012)**
*   **Who:** The "Feedback" guys.
*   **What they found:** Proposed that the energy from the black hole (AGN) pushes gas away, stopping the black hole from growing too big.
*   **Why you cite them:** This is the mechanism that usually *stops* growth. Your argument is that in Clusters, this mechanism gets "overwhelmed" or "recycled."

### 🔭 The Data Sources (Where you got your numbers)
*If someone asks: "Where did you get these masses?" - You point to these.*

**4. McConnell & Ma (2013)**
*   **Who:** A massive compilation of black hole masses.
*   **Significance:** Most of the "standard" measurements come from here.
*   **Defense:** "I used the McConnell & Ma catalog because it's the gold standard for dynamical mass measurements in the local universe."

**5. EHT Collaboration (2019)**
*   **Who:** The team that took the picture of the black hole in M87.
*   **Why you cite them:** To show you have the most accurate, recent mass for M87 ($6.5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$), not an old estimate.

### 🌧️ The Physical Model (Your Explanation)
*If someone asks: "Why are they overmassive?" - You point to these.*

**6. Gaspari et al. (2013) / Voit et al. (2015)**
*   **The Idea:** "Precipitation" or "Chaotic Cold Accretion."
*   **Explanation:** In galaxy clusters, the hot gas rains down ("precipitates") like weather.
*   **Why you cite them:** They provide the theoretical reason for your results. You aren't just finding a correlation; you are finding evidence for *their* theory.

**7. McDonald et al. (2019)**
*   **Who:** Studied the Phoenix Cluster (Phoenix A).
*   **What they found:** The black hole is growing incredibly fast ("starburst" mode) right now.
*   **Why you cite them:** Justification for why Phoenix A is such an extreme outlier—it's currently eating a lot of gas!

### 🛡️ Common Defense Responses

**Allegation:** "You just picked random data from the internet."
**Response:** "No, I strictly used dynamical mass measurements from peer-reviewed catalogs like **McConnell & Ma (2013)** and recent updates like the **EHT results (2019)**."

**Allegation:** "This theory about cluster gas makes no sense."
**Response:** "Actually, it aligns with the 'precipitation models' proposed by **Gaspari et al.** and **Voit et al.**, which predict that feedback loops change in massive cluster environments."

**Allegation:** "Your comparison sample is biased."
**Response:** "I used standard field ellipticals that define the **Kormendy & Ho (2013)** relation to ensure a fair baseline."
