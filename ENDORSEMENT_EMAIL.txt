Subject: Request for arXiv endorsement (astro-ph.GA) - Student Research on BCG Black Holes

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I am a Class 11 student from Bankura, West Bengal, conducting independent research on supermassive black hole scaling relations. I have recently completed a statistical analysis of 14 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) using publicly available dynamical mass data.

I am writing to respectfully request your endorsement to submit my preprint, "Evidence for Environmental Dependence in the Growth of Supermassive Black Holes in Brightest Cluster Galaxies," to the arXiv **astro-ph.GA** category.

**Key Findings:**
1.  BCG black holes are systematically overmassive ($\sim 2.6\times$) compared to field galaxies of similar stellar mass.
2.  Methods: I utilized non-parametric statistics (Spearman rank correlation) to ensure robustness against heterogeneous data sources.
3.  Result: I discovered a strong monotonic correlation ($\rho = 0.83, p < 0.001$) between black hole overmassiveness and host cluster mass, supporting "precipitation" and cooling flow feedback models (e.g., Gaspari et al. 2013, Voit et al. 2015).

I have attached the manuscript for your review. I have been careful to cite standard data sources (McConnell & Ma 2013, Kormendy & Ho 2013) and have explicitly disclosed the use of AI tools for code assistance in the Acknowledgments to maintain high ethical standards.

I would be deeply grateful if you could spare a moment to review the abstract or paper and consider providing an endorsement.

Thank you for your time and for supporting student research.

Sincerely,
